// If your application makes constant use of the network, itâ€™s probably most efficient to set up a single instance of RequestQueue that will last the lifetime of your app as our app can do one api call at a time and so, if there is only one  request queue for all activities that are calling diff api..we can put them in one queue one by one and can process them accordingly.
//  This ensures that the RequestQueue will last for the lifetime of your app, instead of being recreated every time the activity is recreated (for example, when the user rotates the device).
